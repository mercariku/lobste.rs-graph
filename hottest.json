Doubly so in unfamiliar code. You end up going down multiple paths, trying out any number of changes, adding tracing and consistency-checking code to verify your assumptions. You end up manually annotating huge traces for a single test case, just to figure out which way is up (this is in the context of code generation, but I think it applies more widely). You start noting things down just so that you don't end up retracing your steps (... too often).\r\n\r\nYou occasionally engage in breadth-first search, exploring a number of debugging approaches, just so you can get a feel for the RoI on each path. You may have already made significant code changes in your pursuit of a fix, only to realize that this is a dead-end and some of your traces and/or assumptions are now invalid.\r\n\r\nSomething looked like an inconsistency but, after a lot of time spent understanding the code, turns out to be OK.
